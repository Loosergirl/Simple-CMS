## Functionality
We have chosen to make a blogpost system for users to write their own blog-posts and share them. The user should be able to create a new user, login/logout, write blogposts and delete/edit blogposts. Admin can delete and edit all users posts. Non-Admin users can only delete and edit their own posts.

### Theme
The theme of the website is architecture, here you can via blogposts share your thoughts and pictures on impressive architecture. The colors we are using is giving the website a fresh and modern look.

## Things to improve or add
* Users should be able to comment on every blogpost.
* We should have had during the project more daily checkups and improved the overall planning.
